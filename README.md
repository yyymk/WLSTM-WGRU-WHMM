# Solving SPS Resource Allocation with Multiple Time-Series Models

This repository contains three different time-series models designed for solving the **SPS Resource Allocation Problem**: **WGRU**, **WHMM**, and **WLSTM**. Each model utilizes advanced techniques to predict scheduling patterns, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of SPS resource allocation in various applications.
## Models Overview
### 1. **WGRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

A model based on **Gated Recurrent Unit** (GRU), designed to capture short-term temporal dependencies in SPS resource allocation data and make accurate predictions.

### 2. **WHMM (Hidden Markov Model)**

A **Hidden Markov Model** (HMM) variant that models state transitions and temporal dynamics in SPS resource allocation tasks.

### 3. **WLSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

A **Long Short-Term Memory** (LSTM) based model that captures long-range dependencies in SPS resource allocation tasks.

## Model Implementation
Each model has been implemented in its respective folder. **Each folder contains a dedicated README.md file with detailed setup instructions, usage guidelines, and specific characteristics of the model.** The models are designed to be used for time-series forecasting tasks, specifically applied to SPS resource allocation.
