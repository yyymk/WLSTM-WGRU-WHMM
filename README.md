This repository contains three different time-series models designed for scheduling tasks:** WGRU, WHMM, and WLSTM**. Each model leverages advanced techniques for predicting scheduling patterns, with the goal of improving the efficiency and accuracy of scheduling in various applications.

- **WGRU:** A model based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), designed to capture short-term temporal dependencies in SPS resource allocation data and make accurate predictions.
- **WHMM:** A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) variant that models state transitions and temporal dynamics in SPS resource allocation tasks.
- **WLSTM:** A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model that captures long-range dependencies in SPS resource allocation tasks.

README.md file detailing the setup, usage instructions, and specific characteristics of each model. The project is intended for users seeking to apply time-series forecasting models to the SPS resource allocation problem and evaluate their performance in different settings.
